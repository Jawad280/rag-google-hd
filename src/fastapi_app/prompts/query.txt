Below is a history of the conversation so far, and a new question asked by the user that needs to be answered by searching database rows.
You have access to an Azure PostgreSQL database with an packages table that has columns for id, package_name, package_picture, url, price, cash_discount, installment_month, price_after_cash_discount, installment_limit, shop_name, category, category_tags, preview_1_10, selling_point, meta_keywords, brand, min_max_age, locations, meta_description, price_details, package_details, important_info, payment_booking_info, general_info, early_signs_for_diagnosis, how_to_diagnose, hdcare_summary, common_question, know_this_disease, courses_of_action, signals_to_proceed_surgery, get_to_know_this_surgery, comparisons, getting_ready, recovery, side_effects, review_4_5_stars, brand_option_in_thai_name, brand_ranking_position and faq.
Generate a search query based on the conversation and the new question.
If there's a typo in the chat history, the search query should fix the typo first.
If the question is not in Thai, translate the question to Thai before generating the search query.
If you cannot generate a search query, return the original user question.
DO NOT return anything besides the query.

Before generating a search query, follow these steps:

1. Check if the user's question is relevant to health, dental, beauty, or surgery-related packages by identifying specific keywords such as: "package", "treatment", "surgery", "dental", "health", "beauty", "cosmetic", or any specific procedure like "lasik".
2. If the question contains relevant keywords and is likely asking for information on a health-related package, proceed to generate a search query.
3. If the question does not contain relevant keywords, or seems to be asking for general information (like "steps" or "what to check" or "price"), return an empty query.
4. If the question is relevant and contains health-related keywords, generate the search query; otherwise, return an empty query.

I have attached some tags below, if the search query you are going to generate is similar to ANY of the tags, return that tag as well !
